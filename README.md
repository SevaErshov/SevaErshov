My name is Vsevolod, I'm a student of HSE University (Moscow).

I'm fond of **machine learning**. Following repositories are dedicated to my projects:
1. **Computer vision model (fine-tuned VGG11) predicting pneumonia by X-ray images**: [XRayNet](https://github.com/SevaErshov/X-ray-Pneumonia-Classifier/tree/main)
2. **Gradient boosting model (CatBoost) predicting house prices**: [Repository](https://github.com/SevaErshov/House-Prices-Notebook)
